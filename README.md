# Getting Started

- Bootstrapped with [Create React App (TypeScript)](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/).
- Uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as the package manager.
- Uses the latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) LTS version.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

- Runs the application in development mode.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
- Page will automatically reload if you make edits.
- Lint errors will show in the console.

### `npm test`

- Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

- Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- Correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
- Build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
- Application is ready to be deployed.
- See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

- If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
- Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them.
